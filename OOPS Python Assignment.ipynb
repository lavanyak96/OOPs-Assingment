    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It restricts access to some of the object's components, providing data hiding and protecting the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts. In OOP, abstraction allows you to hide the unnecessary details of an object and only expose the essential features. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create a new class by inheriting properties and behaviors from an existing class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a parent-child relationship between classes. Subclasses inherit attributes and methods from their parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This allows for flexibility in coding and enables the use of methods that can work with objects of different types. Polymorphism includes concepts like method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars provide a foundation for designing and building object-oriented software systems by promoting principles such as code reusability, modularity, and maintainability."
